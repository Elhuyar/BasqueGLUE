 Basque Named Entities Corpus for out of domain Basque NERC

The training data is the merge of EIEC (a dataset of a collection of news 
wire articles from Euskaldunon Egunkaria newspaper, (Alegria et al. 2004)), 
and newly annotated data from naiz.eus. For validation and test sets, sentences 
from Wikipedia were annotated following the same annotation guidelines.

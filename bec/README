 - Polarity: Polarity is annotated with respect to one the whole tweet. Original polarity was manually annotated with respect to one or more target entity per tweet. In order to map entity level polarity to sentence level polarity only those tweets where all entities were annotated with the same polarity are selected.
 
            Possible values for polarity are: P(positive) | N(negative) | NEU(neutral)


  Annotation was done by three people. 



 Crawling
-----------------------

Crawling was carried out during the election campaign period, starting on September 9th (00:00am) and finishing on September 23th (23:59pm). Mentions written in Basque and Spanish were crawled. This dataset only contains the Basque mentions.

The main parties and their respective candidates were monitored:
   - PNV : Iñigo Urkullu
   - PSE : Idoia Mendia
   - EH Bildu : Arnaldo Otegi*
   - PP : Alfonso Alonso
   - C's : Nicolas De Miguel.

 *Arnaldo Otegi was banned as an official candidate. Still EH Bildu declared him as their candidate, and he took the role during the campaign. Thus we assumed him as the target candidate to be monitored.

A total amount of 52 keywords were defined to monitor 12 entities (6 parties and 6 candidates).

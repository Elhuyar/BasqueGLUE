 EpecKorrefBin: Basque Coreference Binary Corpus 
===================================================

EPEC-KORREF-Bin is a dataset derived from EPEC-KORREF (Soraluze et al.), a corpus of Basque news documents with 
manually annotated mentions and coreference chains, which we have been converted into a binary classification task.


Coreference resolution involves clustering mentions into entities. Thus, we decided to convert it into a binary 
classification problem, adopting the same format used for the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) task (Levesque et al., 2012).
In this new task, the model has to predict whether two mentions from a text, which can be pronouns, nouns or noun phrases, 
are referring to the same entity. We adapted EPEC-KORREF to this task, and we renamed this dataset as EpecKorrefBin. 
We limited mention pairs to those in the same sentence or consecutive sentences.

To create negative examples, we selected mention pairs which included 1 pronoun or have the same mention
type (e.g. both being proper nouns for locations). Then, in an attempt to make the task more challenging, 
we filtered out the most similar mention pairs among positive examples and also those which were most different
from the negative ones. Levenshtein distance for positive examples and token set ratio for negatives were
used as string similarity measures. Finally, we ensured that all the splits (train/dev/test) are balanced for 
positive and negative examples.

 WiC for Basque 
===================================================

Word in Context or WiC (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) is a word sense disambiguation (WSD)
task, designed as a particular form of sentence pair binary classification. 

Given two text snippets and a polyse mous word that appears in both of them (the span of
the word is marked in both snippets), the task is to de termine whether the word has the same 
sense in both sentences. Performance is evaluated using accuracy.

We generated a dataset taking EPEC-EuSemcor (Pociello et al., 2011) corpus as a starting point. 
EPEC-EuSemcor is a sense-tagged corpus for Basque. This corpus comprises a set of occurrences of 
nouns which have been annotated with Basque WordNet v1.6 senses (Pociello et al., 2011). It contains 
42,615 occurrences of nouns manually annotated, corresponding to the 407 most frequent Basque nouns. 
We only made use of occurrences from context sentences of 10-50 words in length.

The Basque WiC dataset follows the design of the English WiC dataset (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019), 
pairing context sentences for each noun to create the instances of the classification task.

We adopted the same strategy as in the English dataset to boost the clarity of the dataset and removed all
pairs whose senses were first degree connections in the WordNet semantic graph, including sister senses,
and those which belong to the same supersense. For this pruning we used a mapping from Wordnet v1.6 to
Wordnet v3.0, as it is customary for other datasets related to WSD (Raganato et al., 2017).

The constraint of not having repeated contextual sentences was enforced across the test and development
sets. 

Thus, we set apart 1,400 and 600 instances for the test and development sets, respectively.
The remaining pairs whose context sentences did not overlap with the test and development sets formed our
training data (where we allow the repetition of the context sentences, to increase the training data size).
Lastly, we ensured that all the splits are balanced for positive and negative examples.

Dataset format and distribution

# The dataset is divided into three files: train validation and test splits. 

408,559 train.jsonl (compressed due to it's size)

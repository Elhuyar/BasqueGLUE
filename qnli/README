 QNLI for Basque 
===================================================

In order to create a NLI task on QA domain, we 
adapted the QA dataset ElkarHizketak (Otegi et al., 2020), 
a low resource conversational Question Answering (QA) 
dataset for Basque created by native speaker volunteers. 
The dataset is built on top of Wikipedia sections about 
popular people and organizations and it contains around 
400 dialogues and 1600 question and answers.

We adapted this dataset into a sentence pair binary 
clas sification tasks, following the design of QNLI for
English (Wang et al., 2019). We form a pair between each
question and each sentence in the corresponding context 
and then filter out the pairs with the lowest lexical
overlap between the question and the sentence in case
of negative samples, until we are left with a balanced
dataset, formed by train, dev and test splits. As evaluation 
metric, we follow the English QNLI design and use accuracy.
